# ********************************* Scenario: Fix Issue with VolumeMounts in Kubernetes ***************************************************

We deployed a Nginx and PHPFPM based application on Kubernetes cluster last week and it had been working fine. This morning one of the team members made a change somewhere which caused some issues, and the application stopped working. Please look into the issue and fix it:


The pod name is nginx-phpfpm and configmap name is nginx-config, Nginx is running on port 8099. Figure out the issues and fix them.

Once you think issue is fixed copy /tmp/index.php from jump host to nginx-container under nginx document root and try to curl the nginx URL from nginx-container itself, you should be able to run the php page you copied. This step isn't mandatory but it will be helpful to test the setup.

Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution:

1. Check the mount path that is configured in configMap and Pod. If the mountPath is not in sync then change it.

kubectl get configmap nginx-config -o yaml >> /home/thor/nginx-config.yml
kubectl get pod nginx-phpfpm -o yaml >> /home/thor/nginx-phpfpm.yml

2. Once changed in Pod, delete the pod and create new pod using the yaml file

kubectl apply -f /home/thor/nginx-phpfpm.yml

3. copy the index.php file to container

kubectl cp /tmp/index.php nginx-phpfpm:/var/www/html

4. Test the changes

kubectl exec -i -t nginx-phpfpm --container nginx-container -- /bin/bash
curl localhost:8099
