# ************************************** Scenario: Print Environment Variables ****************************************************************

# The Nautilus DevOps team is working on to setup some pre-requisites for an application that will send the greetings to different users. There is a sample deployment, that needs to be tested. Below is a scenario which needs to be configured on Kubernetes cluster. Please find below more details about it.

# Create a pod named print-envars-greeting.

# Configure spec as, the container name should be print-env-container and use bash image.

# Create three environment variables:

# a. GREETING and its value should be Welcome to

# b. COMPANY and its value should be DevOps

# c. GROUP and its value should be Industries

# Use command to echo ["$(GREETING) $(COMPANY) $(GROUP)"] message.

# You can check the output using <kubctl logs -f [ pod-name ]> command.

# Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Solution:

# 1. Create pod based on the specifications

# vi /home/thor/env_pod.yml

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: print-envars-greeting
spec:
  containers:
  - name: print-env-container
    image: bash
    env:
    - name: GREETING 
      value: "Welcome to"
	- name: COMPANY 
      value: "DevOps"
    - name: GROUP 
      value: "Industries"
    command: ["echo"]
	args: ["$(GREETING) $(COMPANY) $(GROUP)"]
	
# 2. create and verify pod output

# kubectl apply -f env_pod.yml  --dry-run=client
# kubectl apply -f env_pod.yml

# kubectl logs <pod-name>
